Linear programme has following structure:
Maximize the objective function f(x1,x2) = x1 + x2
Subject to
x1 + x2 <= -2
x1,x2 >= 0


Initializing simplex

Basic solution is infeasible

Solving auxiliary linear program

Current lp state is:
Objective f(x1,x2,x0) = 0.000  - x0 
Subject to
x3 = -2.000 -1.00*x1 -1.00*x2 +1.00*x0 
x1, x2, x3 >= 0


Entering variable is x0
Leaving variable is x3
Objective f(x1,x2,x3) = -2.000  - x1  - x2  - x3 
Subject to
x0 = 2.000 +1.00*x1 +1.00*x2 +1.00*x3 
x1, x2, x3 >= 0


This linear program is infeasible
